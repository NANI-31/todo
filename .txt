You said:
can you give me the what pages and components should include in frontend

ChatGPT said:
Absolutely! Here’s a clear breakdown of what pages and components your frontend should include for the full-featured To-Do app you described, from basic to advanced features.

🗂 Frontend Structure: Pages & Components
1️⃣ Pages
Pages correspond to routes/views. Each page typically represents a URL path.

Page Name	Description
LoginPage	User login form with email/password and error handling.
RegisterPage	User registration form (name, email, password).
DashboardPage	Main task management interface — shows task list, filters, sorting, and controls.
TaskDetailsPage (optional)	Detailed view/edit of a single task with full fields (description, priority, due date, tags).
ProfilePage (optional)	User profile management (update name, email, password).
NotFoundPage	404 page for unmatched routes.

2️⃣ Components
Reusable building blocks used inside pages or nested components.

Core UI Components
Component Name	Purpose
Button	Custom button with loading/disabled states.
Input	Text input with label and validation support.
Checkbox	Custom checkbox/toggle for task completion.
Modal	Generic modal dialog for confirmations (e.g., delete task).
Spinner/Loader	Loading indicator component.
Toast/Notification	Wrapper to show success/error messages (or use a library like react-toastify).

Task-Related Components
Component Name	Purpose
TaskItem	Single task display: title, checkbox (complete toggle), edit/delete buttons, drag handle.
TaskList	List of tasks, handles rendering of multiple TaskItems.
TaskForm	Form to add or edit a task (title, description, priority, due date, tags).
FilterBar	UI controls for filtering tasks (all/completed/incomplete).
SortMenu	Dropdown or buttons to sort tasks (by date, priority).
SearchBar	Search input to filter tasks by text.
DarkModeToggle	Button or switch to toggle dark/light mode.
TagSelector	Component to select/add tags or categories when editing/adding tasks.

Auth & User Components
Component Name	Purpose
AuthForm	Base form component reused by LoginPage and RegisterPage for inputs.
LogoutButton	Button to log out user and clear tokens/session.
ProtectedRoute	Wrapper component to protect routes that require authentication.

    NotFoundPage.jsx
  /services
    api.js                // Axios instance & API calls
    authService.js        // Auth-specific API calls
    taskService.js        // Task-specific API calls
  App.jsx
  index.jsx
4️⃣ How Components Fit in Pages
LoginPage uses: AuthForm (or individual Input, Button)

RegisterPage uses: AuthForm

DashboardPage uses:

TaskForm (add/edit task)

FilterBar + SortMenu + SearchBar + DarkModeToggle

TaskList (which renders many TaskItems)

LogoutButton

TaskDetailsPage (optional) uses: TaskForm prefilled for edit

ProfilePage uses: input components + Button

If you want, I can help generate sample code snippets for any of these components/pages. Would you like that?
